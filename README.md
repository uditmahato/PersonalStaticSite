Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the code for my little corner of the internet. After my old digital home gathered a bit too much dust, I decided it was time for a **super** simple reboot.

**What's Inside?**

* `HTML` (You know, the skeleton ðŸ’€)
* `CSS` (Making the skeleton look slightly less scary ðŸŽ¨)

Yep, that's literally it. No fancy JavaScript frameworks doing backflips, no server-side shenanigans. Just the basics to say "Hi, I exist online!"

**Can You Use This? ðŸ¤”**

Absolutely! ðŸŽ‰ This is about as complex as boiling water. Feel free to:

* Clone it
* Fork it
* Copy-paste chunks of it
* Use it as a starting point for your own minimalist masterpiece (or placeholder!)

Seriously, there are no hidden secrets or revolutionary techniques here. It's designed to be simple, maybe even *too* simple. Go wild!

*Consider this proof that I can, in fact, still write HTML. More features? Maybe someday... or maybe not! ðŸ˜‰*
